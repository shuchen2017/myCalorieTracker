Next steps:
a. search feature allows user to enter the food and return the calories; 
b. Separate categories: Breakfas, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Drinks, Workout;
c. Make the FE more interactive by adding some JS libraries; 
d. Want to try D3 to add some data visualization features;

e. Add some financial features to budget grocery shopping since food is such a big expenditure for me at least : )
f. Might consider adding backend, database; 
g. multiple users can share their progress; leaderboard, etc.
